# Plan to Implement a Basic RAG Application

## Overview
We will set up a basic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) application in the `src/rag` folder. This involves creating a simple pipeline that retrieves relevant documents and generates responses based on them.

## Steps

1. **Set Up Environment**
   - Ensure all necessary dependencies are installed using the UV package manager.

2. **Create Basic RAG Pipeline**
   - Implement a simple retrieval mechanism to fetch relevant documents.
   - Implement a generation mechanism to create responses based on retrieved documents.

3. **Integrate Components**
   - Combine retrieval and generation components into a cohesive pipeline.

4. **Testing and Validation**
   - Write basic tests to ensure the RAG pipeline functions correctly.

5. **Documentation**
   - Document the setup and usage of the RAG application in the README file.

## Todos
- **setup-environment**: Install necessary dependencies using the UV package manager.
- **implement-retrieval**: Create a function to retrieve relevant documents.
- **implement-generation**: Create a function to generate responses based on retrieved documents.
- **integrate-pipeline**: Combine retrieval and generation into a single pipeline.
- **write-tests**: Develop basic tests to validate the RAG pipeline.
- **update-documentation**: Document the RAG application setup and usage.
